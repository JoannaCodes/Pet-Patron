                    <p>
                    üêæ Pet adoption is the process of transferring responsibility for a pet that was previously owned by another party such as a person, shelter, or rescue organization. Common sources for adoptable pets are animal shelters and rescue groups. Some organizations give adopters ownership of the pet, while others use a guardianship model wherein the organization retains some control over the animal's future use or care.

                    <p>
                    üêæ Online pet adoption sites have databases of pets being housed by thousands of animal shelters and rescue groups, and are searchable by the public.
